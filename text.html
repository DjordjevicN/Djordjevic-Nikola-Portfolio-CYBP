                    <p> My name is Nikola Đorđević.<br>
                        In 2018 I decided to change my career. <br>
                        I wanted to learn about what I was really interested in and what I enjoyed doing in my free
                        time<br>
                        and so I began putting serious effort into creating web sites.<br>
                        That same year, 2018, I quit my job and devoted myself completely to studying and creating. <br>
                        <br>
                        I had 2 possible roads ahead of me: <br>
                        1 – which would lead me back to university<br>
                        2 – which would mean for me to study on my own<br>
                        I decided to study on my own.
                        <br> I began with <i class="fab fa-html5"></i> and <i class="fab fa-css3-alt"></i> .

                        I created a few landing pages.
                        As I have already worked in PhotoShop, PrmierPro, AfterEffects
                        I
                        independently created mock-ups and turned them into code.
                        <br>When I felt ready to move on, I turned to <i class="fab fa-js"></i> .<br>
                        <br>Then I realized that I needed someone to help me find the right direction.
                        <br>ComTrade had a Front End Development course, with a strong focus on JS.
                        I enrolled in it.<br> In September 2019, I graduated with a grade 10.<br>
                        As I was studying, I also worked on JS algorithms on the <i class="fab fa-free-code-camp"></i>
                        and I
                        created pages and small
                        application which are not complete as they have been constructed with a specific idea and
                        testing of
                        new options. When I felt comfortable working with JS i went on to learn <i
                            class="fab fa-react"></i>
                        and to create
                        applications with it.<br><br>
                        Where is the road leading me now?
                        I want to be a professional web developer and to progress my knowledge.
